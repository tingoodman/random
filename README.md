Ramdom.js

Project's name may suggest a new cool javascript's library or framework, but unfortunately
it's just an example of using javascript's 'if' statement which provides me with a test project
to learn how to use the github's service and to complete a compulsory exersice for an on-line 
course I'm doing.

Anyway should you like the project's name you are very welcome to use it and on this way
you get something after wasting your time visiting a 'fake' project.

Good day!
